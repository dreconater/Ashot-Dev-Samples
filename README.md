# Ashot-Dev-Samples
Demonstrative code samples showcasing my coding style, architecture, and problem-solving approach.

Code Samples â€“ Ashot Danielyan

This repository contains a collection of demonstrative code samples from different projects.
Due to NDA and confidentiality agreements, I am unable to share full project repositories. Instead, I have selected representative files that highlight my:

Clean and maintainable code structure

Problem-solving and algorithm design

Use of object-oriented and modular practices

Clear documentation and readability

These examples are intended for evaluation purposes only. If needed, I can also prepare a small demo project to further demonstrate my development approach.
